excerpt: 'I tried to replicate several papers published in field top financial and economic journals and dig into the relationship between UI benefit generosity and workplace safety, but failed due to lack of clean data and good methods. Currently I have cleaned data about UI benefit from 2002-2011 for United States, and some important state-level socioeconomic data. If you are interested in this topic and have better idea, welcome to contract me at wuyudongecon@gmail.com'
